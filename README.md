# photoProcessing
find the files of same name with different suffix

PRD:
Photos exported from Nikon camera has two format, one is NEF and the other is JPEG.
I check the JPEG format photos quickly and delete some useless photos, then I need to delete the same useless files with NEF format.
So scan the JPEG directory and mark the names of useful photos, then scan the NEF directory and delete the useless photos which did not mark as useful.
